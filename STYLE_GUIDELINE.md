## Naming
- Use `PascalCase` for class names, `camelCase` for variables and method, and `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Long, but self-explanatory name is better than short, but unclear one. Avoid abbreviations unless they're widely understood (`mainSoundManager`, not `msm`).
- Omit access modifiers for Unity methods only, always specify them for any other fields.


## Structure
- Order of class fields: static, constant, serialized, properties, public variables, protected/private variables, standart Unity methods (by call order), other methods.
- No global classes - every script belongs to a namespace. Each game must have its own namespace. Keep namespace structure aligned with folder hierarchy, but make it reasonable and no deeper than two levels (excluding game name).
```csharp
// Folder strusture: Game\Core\Audio\Managers.
namespace Game.Core.Audio {}

// Folder strusture: Game\External\Firebase\Processors.
namespace Game.External {}
```


## Formatting
### Attributes
- Order of attributes: `[Tooltip]`, `[All, Other, Attributes]` together in alphabetical order, `[SerializeField]`.  

```csharp
[Tooltip("Tooltip.")]
[AttributeA, AttributeB, AttributeC]
[SerializeField]
private int myField;
```
- Place all attributes above the variable declaration (never inline).

### Layout
- Use expression bodies for methods and propetries with simple expressions whenever possible. However, do not use if for standart Unity methods. 
```csharp
// Bad.
public int MyMethod()
{
    return myVariable;
}

// Better.
public int MyMethod() => myVariable;

// But...
void Update()
{
    myCount++;
}
```
- Use `{ braces }` even for single-line `for/if/else` statements, leaving room for future additions.  
- Separate logic and `return` statement with one empty line in between.
```csharp
if (myFlag == true)
{
    myFlag = false;
    yourFlag = true;

    return myFlag;
}
```


### Directives
- Allign directives (e.g. `#if`, `#define`, etc.) to the leftmost position with no indentation or tabulation.
- Use `#region` to separate code blocks. BUT! First consider whether the code should be moved to a separate file instead.
```csharp
#region My Region Name
    ...
#endregion
```


## Comments
- Always begin any comment text with an uppercase letter and end it with a period. Place comments on a separate line, not at the end of a line of code. Insert one space between the comment `// delimiter` and its text. Avoid using `/* multiline */` comments.  
```csharp
// This is a good comment.
var myVariable = 5;
```

- Use `<summary>` tag for function and class comments describing details above it. Omit `<param>` and `<returns>` if the description is redundant (e.g. `<returns>` can be omited for Coroutines).  
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Do something with a variable (as a number).
/// </summary>
/// <param name="myVariable">My number.</param>
/// <returns>Another number.</returns>
private int MyFunction(int myVariable)
{
    ...
}
```
