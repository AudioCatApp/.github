## Naming
- Use `PascalCase` for class, interface, enum, struct, method, property names, `camelCase` for variables, and `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Fortunally, letters are for free. Long but self-explanatory name is better than short but unclear one. Avoid abbreviations unless they're widely understood (`mainSoundManager`, not `msm`).
- Omit access modifiers for Unity methods only, always specify them for any other fields.
- Interface names must start with letter `I` and describe a capability (e.g. `IComparable`, `IDrinkable`).
- When a class inherits from a self-explanatory base and its role purpose are clear from the context, ignore the base name (e.g. `MainMenu` as a child of `UIManager` is totally fine), but if the name alone is too vague and the role is unclear, keep the base name as prefix (`AudioManagerWordy`, not just `Wordy` that inherits from `AudioManager` class).
- Method names should include verbs or verb phrases, boolean-returning methods should start with "is", "can", "has" (e.g. `PlayAudio()`, `CanWork()`, `HasTime()`).
- Name events/actions following the OnSomethingHappened pattern (e.g. `OnVictoriaGotTired`, `OnBenjiSucceeded`).


## Structure
- Order of data structure fields: static, constant, serialized, properties, public variables, protected/private variables, standart Unity methods (by call order), other methods.
- NO GLOBAL CLASSES - every script belongs to a namespace. Each game must have its own namespace. Keep namespace structure aligned with folder hierarchy, but make it reasonable and no deeper than two levels (excluding game name).
```csharp
// Folder strusture: Game\Core\Audio\Managers.
namespace Game.Core.Audio {}

// Folder strusture: Game\External\Firebase\Processors.
namespace Game.External {}
```


## Formatting
### Attributes
- Order of attributes: `[Tooltip]`, `[All, Other, Attributes]` together in alphabetical order, `[SerializeField]`.  

```csharp
[Tooltip("Tooltip.")]
[AttributeA, AttributeB, AttributeC]
[SerializeField]
private int myField;
```
- Place all attributes above the variable declaration (never inline).

### Layout
- Use expression bodies for methods and propetries with simple expressions whenever possible. However, do not use if for standart Unity methods. 
```csharp
// Bad.
public int MyMethod()
{
    return myVariable + 1;
}

// Better.
public int MyMethod() => myVariable++;

// But...
void Update()
{
    myCount++;
}
```
- Use `{ braces }` even for single-line control flow statements (e.g. `if`, `for`, `try`, etc.), leaving room for future additions.  
- Separate logic and `return` statement with one empty line in between.
```csharp
if (myFlag == true)
{
    myFlag = false;
    yourFlag = true;

    return myFlag;
}
```


### Directives
- Allign directives (e.g. `#if`, `#define`, etc.) to the leftmost position with no indentation or tabulation.
- Use `#region` to separate code blocks. BUT! First consider whether the code should be moved to a separate file instead. Align it as IDE automatically does.
```csharp
#region My Region Name
    ...
#endregion
```


## Comments
- Always begin any comment text with an uppercase letter and end it with a period. Place comments on a separate line, not at the end of a line of code. Insert one space between the comment `// delimiter` and its text. Avoid using `/* multiline */` comments.  
```csharp
// This is a good comment.
var myVariable = 5;
```

- Use `<summary>` tag for function and class comments describing details above it. Omit `<param>` and `<returns>` if the description is redundant (e.g. `<returns>` can be omited for Coroutines).  
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Do something with a variable (as a number).
/// </summary>
/// <param name="myVariable">My number.</param>
/// <returns>Another number.</returns>
private int MyFunction(int myVariable)
{
    ...
}
```
